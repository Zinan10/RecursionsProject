# Requirements
The requirements for the project involved the building of multiple recursive functions and understand how they operate.
These recursive functions were namely:

- Head and Tail Recursion
- Fibonacci
- Factorial
- Iterative

# Accomplishments

I was able to successfully build multiple classes each making use of different recursive functions, all of which get displayed in the main method.

# Future Work

- Implement a factory design pattern to give better class design to the program
- implement interfaces
- Add a read line method that would collect input for the data and base the recursive values on the value entered.
- Add input validation to the option above.
